PROBLEM  STATEMENT  :
		Containment Zone Alerting Application is the process that alert a people of the Covid-19 containment zones and 
prevent trespassing into these zones. This application updates the locations of the areas in a Google map which are identified to be the containment zones. 
Recently, several containment zones had been identified throughout the country and divided into red, orange and green zones. The red zones indicate the infection  
hotspots, orange zones denote some infection and green zones indicate an area with no infection. The application also notifies the users if they have entered a 
containment zone and uploads the user’s IMEI number to the online database. So, people can get awareness about a current containment zone throughout the notification.
